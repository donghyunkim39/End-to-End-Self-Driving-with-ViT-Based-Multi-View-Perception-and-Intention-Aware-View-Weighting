# End-to-End-Self-Driving-with-ViT-Based-Multi-View-Perception-and-Intention-Aware-View-Weighting
This work proposes an end-to-end autonomous driving model that dynamically adjusts attention across left, front, and right views based on the human driver’s driving intention, and further refines view importance according to road complexity even under the same intention.
