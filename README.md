# End-to-End-Self-Driving-with-ViT-Based-Multi-View-Perception-and-Intention-Aware-View-Weighting
This repository provides a dataset collected in the CARLA simulator (v0.9.15) for End-to-End autonomous driving research. The dataset includes synchronized multi-view camera images (left, front, right), corresponding steering commands, vehicle speed, and High-Level Commands (HLC), all obtained using CARLA’s built-in Autopilot.
